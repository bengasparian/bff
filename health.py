"""Write status.json after every data run: whether each step worked, the season the site is on, when the page was last
built successfully, and which forecasts the weekly projection stack used (m = BFF's model, r = the experts' ranks,
s = Sleeper, e = ESPN; 'fallback' = neither site answered, so the tested 40% model / 60% experts mix ran). It changes at
most once a day when all is well, which also keeps the repository active so GitHub never pauses the scheduled jobs (it
pauses them after 60 days without activity in a public repository).
