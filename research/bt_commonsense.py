"""BFF research: do the 'common sense' checks make buy-low and sell-high calls better?

Buy low (as on the site): a non-QB averaging at least 8 expected PPR points a game from his usage (targets and carries,
by where and how deep they come) and scoring at least 2.5 a game less. Sell high: scoring at least 10 a game and at least
3 above his usage. Judged on what happens next: his points per game over the rest of the season (weeks w-17) against
what he had averaged so far (the price in a trade). A good buy-low scores more from here; a good sell-high scores less.
The checks tested (2020-25 regular seasons, weeks 4-13, the trade window):
  fill-in    his usage came while a starter at his position was out (research/bt_fillin.py rule) and that starter is
             back this week or came back within the last two weeks
  two games  only two games played so far
  role down  his snap share over his last two games is under 75% of his season share
  starter    the returning starter's own line (often a buy low after injury-shortened games)
  stud       his usage already ranks in the top 6 at his position (a buy low then leans on usage that tends to fall back;
             a sell high gives up a player who stays elite)
