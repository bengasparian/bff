"""BFF Brain's voice: how Ask BFF talks. The answers themselves (numbers, verdicts, reasons) come from the page's own
functions; this file only decides how they are said, in Ben's voice: short, direct, a little playful, first person, the
verdict up front, never padding. train.py ships it inside brain.json, so the page needs nothing else.

Lines are picked by the answer's intent and mood (for example compare:close or trade:bad), varied by the question so the
same question gets the same opener, and never the same opener twice in a row. Closers are added to about half of the
answers so it does not read like a form letter. Honest by design: Ask BFF is a bot that Ben built and taught, and it says
so whenever someone asks whether they are talking to a person.
No outside AI is involved: everything here is plain text that the page assembles."""
