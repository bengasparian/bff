Each entry: (id, [ways people ask it], answer[, last season it is current for]). The page skips an entry once the
site's season is past that season (dates and records that change), so nothing goes stale. Answers are short, plain and checked against official sources

  'The offense gets <b>four downs</b> (plays) to gain <b>10 yards</b>. Make it and you earn a new first down; fail and the ball goes to the other team. "3rd and 5" means it is the third try and 5 yards are still needed. '
  'Teams usually punt or kick a field goal on 4th down; going for it and failing is a <b>turnover on downs</b>.'),

  '<b>Regular season</b> (since 2025): one <b>10-minute</b> period, and <b>both teams get a possession</b> even if the first one ends in a touchdown; after that the next score wins, and if it is still tied when time runs out, the game is a <b>tie</b>. '
  '<b>Playoffs</b>: 15-minute periods, both teams get a possession, and they keep playing until someone wins.'),
 ('play_clock', ['what is the play clock', 'how long is the play clock', 'delay of game'],
  'After a play ends the offense has <b>40 seconds</b> to snap the ball (<b>25</b> after stoppages like timeouts and penalties). Running out of time is <b>delay of game</b>, a 5-yard penalty.'),
 ('timeouts', ['how many timeouts does each team get', 'do timeouts carry over', 'how many timeouts in overtime'],

 ('kickoff', ['how do kickoffs work', 'what is the dynamic kickoff', 'where is a touchback on a kickoff', 'new kickoff rule', 'what is a touchback'],
  'Since 2024 the NFL uses the <b>dynamic kickoff</b>: the kicker kicks from his 35, the other players line up near midfield and cannot move until the ball lands or is touched. '
  'A kick into the end zone that is not returned is a <b>touchback</b> to the receiving team\'s <b>35-yard line</b> (since 2025); one that lands short of the landing zone (inside the 20) comes out to the 40. A punt touchback comes out to the 20.'),
 ('pat', ['where is the extra point kicked from', 'how long is an extra point', 'where is a two point conversion from'],
  'The <b>extra point</b> is snapped from the 15-yard line (about a 33-yard kick). A <b>two-point try</b> is snapped from the 2-yard line.'),
 ('safety', ['what is a safety', 'how do you get a safety', 'what happens after a safety', 'how much is a safety worth', 'safety points'],
  'A <b>safety</b> happens when the offense is tackled (or fumbles out, or commits certain penalties) in its own end zone. The defense gets <b>2 points and the ball</b>: the team that gave up the safety kicks it away from its own 20.'),
 ('fair_catch', ['what is a fair catch', 'how does a fair catch work'],

 ('turnovers', ['what is a turnover', 'what is a fumble', 'what is an interception', 'what is a pick six', 'what is a strip sack'],
  'A <b>turnover</b> gives the ball to the other team: an <b>interception</b> (a defender catches a pass), a <b>lost fumble</b> (the ball carrier drops it and the defense recovers) or a turnover on downs. '
  'A <b>pick-six</b> is an interception returned for a touchdown; a <b>strip-sack</b> is a sack where the defender knocks the ball loose.'),
 ('sack', ['what is a sack', 'what counts as a sack'],
  'A <b>sack</b> is when the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage while trying to pass. It counts as a loss of yards on that down.'),

  '<b>Roughing the passer</b>: 15 yards and a first down. <b>Intentional grounding</b>: loss of down and 10 yards or the spot of the foul (a safety if it happens in the end zone).'),
 ('red_zone', ['what is the red zone', 'what does red zone mean', 'what is the goal line'],
  'The <b>red zone</b> is inside the opponent\'s 20-yard line, where most touchdowns are scored. Inside the 5 is often called the <b>goal line</b>. BFF counts red-zone targets and carries as part of a player\'s usage.'),

  'Offense: <b>quarterback</b> (throws, runs the offense), <b>running back</b> (runs and catches short passes), <b>fullback</b> (lead blocker), <b>wide receivers</b> (catch passes), <b>tight end</b> (blocks and catches), and five <b>offensive linemen</b> (center, two guards, two tackles). '
  'Defense: <b>defensive linemen</b> (rush the passer, stop the run), <b>linebackers</b>, <b>cornerbacks</b> (cover receivers) and <b>safeties</b> (deep coverage). Special teams: kicker, punter, long snapper and returners.'),
 ('coverage', ['what is cover 2', 'what is cover 3', 'man vs zone coverage', 'what is a blitz', 'what is nickel defense', 'what is dime defense'],
  'In <b>man</b> coverage each defender follows one receiver; in <b>zone</b> each covers an area. <b>Cover 2</b> splits the deep field between two safeties; <b>Cover 3</b> splits it into thirds. '
  'A <b>blitz</b> sends extra rushers (often a linebacker or defensive back). <b>Nickel</b> uses a fifth defensive back, <b>dime</b> a sixth.'),
 ('plays', ['what is play action', 'what is an rpo', 'what is a screen pass', 'what is a draw play', 'what is a hail mary', 'what is an onside kick', 'what is a flea flicker', 'what is a trick play'],
  '<b>Play-action</b>: fake a handoff, then pass. <b>RPO</b> (run-pass option): the QB reads a defender after the snap and hands off or throws. <b>Screen</b>: a short pass behind blockers. <b>Draw</b>: looks like a pass, then a delayed run. '
  '<b>Hail Mary</b>: a long desperation pass to the end zone. <b>Onside kick</b>: a short kickoff the kicking team tries to recover. <b>Flea flicker</b>: a handoff, a pitch back to the QB, then a deep pass.'),

 ('draft', ['how does the nfl draft work', 'how many rounds in the nfl draft', 'who picks first in the draft', 'what are compensatory picks'],
  'The NFL Draft has <b>7 rounds</b>. Teams that missed the playoffs pick first, worst record first; playoff teams follow in order of how far they went, and the Super Bowl champion picks last. '
  'Extra <b>compensatory picks</b> (rounds 3-7) go to teams that lost more free agents than they signed. Picks can be traded.'),
 ('rookie_contracts', ['how long are rookie contracts', 'what is the fifth year option', 'what is a franchise tag'],
  'Drafted rookies sign <b>4-year</b> contracts; first-round picks also carry a <b>fifth-year option</b> the team can pick up. The <b>franchise tag</b> lets a team keep a player about to become a free agent on a one-year deal at a set (high) salary.'),

  'BFF projects 0 points while a player is on any of these lists and starts projecting him again in his expected return week.'),
 ('injury_report', ['what does questionable mean', 'what does doubtful mean', 'what does out mean', 'how does the injury report work', 'what does dnp mean', 'what does limited practice mean'],
  'On the official injury report, <b>Out</b> means he will not play, <b>Doubtful</b> means unlikely, and <b>Questionable</b> means uncertain. Practice reports say <b>DNP</b> (did not practice), <b>Limited</b> or <b>Full</b>. '
  'In 2021-2025 data, Out players played 0.1% of the time, Doubtful 0.4% and Questionable 61%, which is why BFF projects Out and Doubtful players for 0.'),
 ('prime_time', ['what is thursday night football', 'what is monday night football', 'what is sunday night football', 'what is tnf', 'what is snf', 'what is mnf'],
  '<b>Thursday Night Football</b>, <b>Sunday Night Football</b> and <b>Monday Night Football</b> are the stand-alone prime-time games each week. In fantasy, players in the Thursday game lock first, so set those lineups early.'),

 ('superflex', ['what is superflex', 'what is a superflex league', 'should i start two quarterbacks'],
  '<b>Superflex</b>: a flex spot that can also hold a quarterback. Quarterbacks score the most, so most teams start two and they are worth far more (set SF to 1 in BFF and values adjust).'),
 ('handcuff', ['what is a handcuff', 'should i draft handcuffs'],
  'A <b>handcuff</b> is the backup to a starting running back: if the starter gets hurt, the backup inherits much of his work. Handcuffs matter most for backs who get nearly all of their team\'s carries.'),

  'On the <b>waiver wire</b>, dropped and unrostered players can be claimed. With rolling priority, the team that claims moves to the back of the line; with <b>FAAB</b> (free agent acquisition budget), each team bids from a season budget and the highest bid wins.'),
 ('bye_week', ['what is a bye week', 'what happens on a bye'],
  'A <b>bye week</b> is the one week each team does not play; its players score 0 that week, so have a replacement ready.'),

  '<b>D/ST</b> scores for sacks, interceptions, fumble recoveries, defensive and return touchdowns, safeties and few points allowed. <b>Kickers</b> usually get 3 for a field goal (more for long ones) and 1 per extra point. '
  'Both swing a lot week to week, so most managers draft them last and <b>stream</b> them by matchup. BFF does not rank them.'),
 ('league_types', ['what is dynasty', 'what is a keeper league', 'what is best ball', 'what is redraft', 'what is a guillotine league'],
  '<b>Redraft</b>: a fresh draft every season (what BFF values are built for). <b>Keeper</b>: each team keeps a few players for next season. <b>Dynasty</b>: you keep your whole roster year to year, so young players are worth more. '
  '<b>Best ball</b>: no lineup setting; your top scorers count automatically.'),
 ('adp', ['what is adp', 'what is average draft position'],
  '<b>ADP</b> (average draft position) is where a player usually goes in drafts. BFF\'s draft guide uses the FantasyPros consensus as its guide to where players go.'),
 ('draft_strategy', ['what is zero rb', 'what is hero rb', 'what is robust rb', 'what is the best draft strategy', 'should i draft a qb early'],
  '<b>Zero RB</b> waits on running backs and loads up on receivers early; <b>Hero RB</b> takes one elite back early then waits; <b>Robust RB</b> takes several backs early. '
  'In one-quarterback leagues, waiting on a quarterback is usually fine because many score similarly; in superflex take two early. Try strategies against AI teams in the Mock draft.'),
 ('stack_stream', ['what is a stack', 'what is streaming', 'should i stack my qb', 'what does streaming a defense mean'],
  'A <b>stack</b> pairs a quarterback with his own receivers, so a big passing day counts twice. <b>Streaming</b> means picking up a different player each week (often a QB, TE, kicker or defense) for the best matchup.'),
 ('boom_bust', ['what is a boom', 'what is a bust', 'what is a floor', 'what is a ceiling', 'what does high floor mean', 'what does upside mean'],
  'A player\'s <b>floor</b> is a bad-but-realistic week (BFF uses the 10th percentile) and his <b>ceiling</b> a great one (90th). <b>Boom</b> and <b>bust</b> are the chances of a big week or a dud. '
  'Favored? Lean on floor. Underdog? Chase ceiling.'),
 ('sleeper_term', ['what is a sleeper', 'what does sleeper mean in fantasy'],
  'A <b>sleeper</b> is a player who usually ranks outside the starter tier but should score like a starter, this week or over the season. BFF\'s cheat sheet lists weekly sleepers.'),
 ('buy_sell_term', ['what is buy low', 'what is sell high', 'what does regression mean in fantasy', 'what is positive regression'],
  '<b>Buy low</b>: a player scoring well below what his usage is usually worth (bad luck tends to even out). <b>Sell high</b>: scoring well above his usage, usually from touchdowns or long plays that rarely repeat. '
  'That evening-out is <b>regression to the mean</b>.'),

  'A <b>target</b> is a pass thrown to a player, caught or not. <b>Target share</b>: his share of the team\'s targets. <b>Snap share</b>: share of offensive plays he is on the field. <b>Air yards</b>: how far past the line of scrimmage his targets travel; <b>aDOT</b> is their average. '
  '<b>WOPR</b> = 1.5 × target share + 0.7 × air-yards share. <b>Yards per route run</b> = receiving yards ÷ routes. <b>Expected fantasy points (xFP)</b>: what his targets and carries usually score given depth and field position.'),
 ('advanced_terms', ['what is epa', 'what is cpoe', 'what is success rate', 'what is pass rate over expected', 'what is proe', 'what is dvoa'],
  '<b>EPA</b> (expected points added): how much a play changed the expected points of the drive, based on down, distance and field position. <b>CPOE</b>: completion % above what the throws\' difficulty predicts. '
  '<b>Success rate</b>: share of plays with positive EPA. <b>PROE</b> (pass rate over expected): how much more a team passes than the situation predicts; BFF uses it for team pace and play calling.'),
 ('vorp_term', ['what is vorp', 'what is value over replacement', 'what is replacement level'],
  '<b>VORP</b> (value over replacement player) is the points a player should score above the best player at his position likely available on waivers. It makes up 15% of BFF value; the rest is points above the best player who would not start in your league.'),
 ('vulture_committee', ['what is a vulture', 'what is a committee backfield', 'what is a rbbc', 'what is garbage time', 'what is game script'],
  'A <b>vulture</b> steals short touchdowns from the main back (often a big back or the QB). A <b>committee</b> splits carries between backs. <b>Garbage time</b> is late in a lopsided game when stats pile up against soft defense. '
  '<b>Game script</b>: teams that lead run more; teams that trail throw more.'),
 ('ir_slot', ['what is an ir slot', 'can i put a questionable player on ir', 'what is the trade deadline in fantasy'],
  'An <b>IR slot</b> in fantasy holds a player your league platform lists as injured (rules vary: some allow Out, some only IR) without using a bench spot. Fantasy trade deadlines are set by each league, often around week 10-12.'),
 ('fantasy_playoffs', ['when are the fantasy playoffs', 'what weeks are fantasy playoffs', 'how many teams make fantasy playoffs'],

  'The <b>spread</b> is the favorite\'s expected margin: a 3-point favorite (-3) must win by more than 3 to <b>cover</b>. The <b>moneyline</b> is a bet on who wins outright. The <b>over/under</b> (total) is the expected combined score. '
  '<b>-110</b> means you risk 110 to win 100; the extra is the <b>vig</b>. A team\'s <b>implied total</b> = total ÷ 2 + spread ÷ 2 for the favorite (minus for the underdog); BFF uses it in every projection. For entertainment, 21+ where legal.'),
 ('parlay_term', ['what is a parlay', 'what is a same game parlay', 'what is a prop bet', 'what is a player prop', 'what is an anytime touchdown bet'],
  'A <b>parlay</b> combines bets: all legs must win, and the payout multiplies. A <b>same-game parlay</b> takes legs from one game. A <b>player prop</b> is a bet on a player\'s stat, like over 64.5 receiving yards or an anytime touchdown. '
  'BFF predicts the lines and picks only where its projection disagrees enough. For entertainment, 21+ where legal.'),

 ('eligible_receivers', ['can a quarterback catch a pass', 'can an offensive lineman catch a pass', 'who is an eligible receiver', 'what is an eligible receiver', 'can a qb catch a touchdown', 'what is reporting as eligible'],
  'Only <b>eligible receivers</b> may catch a forward pass: the two players on each end of the line and the backs (players at least a yard behind the line). Linemen are ineligible unless they report to the referee as eligible. A quarterback who takes the snap directly from under center is ineligible, but one lined up as a back, such as in the shotgun, can catch a pass: Nick Foles caught a touchdown on the "Philly Special" in Super Bowl LII.'),
 ('win_league', ['how do i win my fantasy league', 'tips to win fantasy football', 'how to get better at fantasy football', 'fantasy football strategy tips', 'how do i make the playoffs in fantasy'],
  'Start your best projected lineup every week, work the waiver wire early in the week for players whose role just grew, trade for players whose usage is better than their points (buy low) and away from the reverse, keep a backup for your most important running back, and check your players\' matchups for the fantasy playoffs (weeks 15-17) before the trade deadline.'),
