"""Predicted prop lines for BFF: what PrizePicks, Underdog and sportsbooks are expected to post this week.

MARKET LINES (refit Oct 25 2026 on 2 samples of real week-7 lines, research/bt_lines.py): books' lines track the public
projections. Every line is set from the average of ESPN's and Sleeper's projection for that stat (site_stats.py,
refreshed every 10 minutes), put through a rule fit to real posted lines:
  receiving yards 0.916 x the market; receptions 0.975 x + 0.15; rushing yards 0.843 x the market + 0.112 x his season
  average - 3.5; passing yards 0.404 x the market + 0.250 x his season average + 0.218 x the market x (Vegas implied
  team total / 22 - 1) + 75.5 (books lean on what a player has done and on the game's total; second refit, Oct 25
  evening); rounded down to .5; passing touchdowns 0.5 below a market projection of 0.95, 2.5 from 2.3, else 1.5 (books
  post 0.5 for low-scoring passers such as Cam Ward, Daniel Jones or Malik Willis).
Scored on players each fit did not use, against the books' lines read Sunday Oct 25 (scoresandodds.com): average gap
3.3 receiving yards (the books themselves spread 3.3 apart), 3.8 rushing yards (books 2.8; was 4.6), 0.25 receptions
(books 0.38; was 0.29), 7.8 passing yards (books 7.2; was 11.1); passing-TD lines match 26 of 28 real lines (was 21 of
25). On the earlier sample (Oct 21-23 lines), each player scored by a fit that left him out: passing 5.6 (was 8.6),
rushing 4.3 (was 4.9).
BFF's own model stays out of the line, so the picks can test it.
PICKS: an under on receiving yards when BFF's own model projects the player at least 10% below ESPN and Sleeper. In
2025, at lines built this way, those unders hit 57.2% (719 picks; every yardage under 54.2%). Passing-yard unders were
picks at the first refit's lines but hit only 52.6% at these closer-to-the-books lines, and rushing-yard unders 52.8%, so
neither is a pick; overs where BFF was higher hit 46.1%. Receptions and passing TDs get no picks: books price those
unders well above even money (often -150 to -200), so a high chance there is not an edge. Each pick says how far below
our line it still holds (2025: 4.5%), because a real book's line can sit lower than ours. "Chance" for every line is how often the over hit in 2025 for
that stat and that gap between BFF and the sites; passing TDs: the books' expected touchdowns read from real odds
(0.578 + 0.676 x the market), scaled to match 2025 for that gap, through a Poisson count. A player neither site projects
gets the model's line (below).

MORE PROPS (Oct 26 2026, research/bt_props_more.py; no picks on any of these):
  pass attempts (quarterbacks): the market projection, its whole number + .5; completions: projected attempts x his
  completion rate (this season and last season at half weight, shrunk 100 attempts toward the league's 64.5%), whole
  number + .5; rush attempts 1.003 x - 0.259; targets 1.025 x (books rarely post targets: set where 2025's overs hit as
  often as receptions'). Against week 7's real lines (scoresandodds.com, Oct 25), every rule scored on players it never
  saw: pass attempts 1.08 from the books' (books 1.25 apart, 24 passers), completions 0.84 (books 0.61, 28), rush
  attempts 0.95 (books 0.48, 82). No side of these hit 55% in both 2025 and 2026, so no picks.
  Interceptions (chance of 1+): projected attempts x his interception rate (this season, last season at 0.66, shrunk
  2,489 attempts toward the league's 2.17%) x 0.963, as a Poisson count; within 3 points of the books' no-vig price on
  average (26 passers, week 7). Anytime TD (rushing, receiving or a return): projected carries and targets at each
  position's touchdown rate x (Vegas implied team total / 22)^1.11 x his own touchdowns per opportunity (this season and
  last, shrunk), fit on 2025 by Poisson likelihood; in 2026 games it never saw it expected 23.9% of players to score and
  22.4% did (2025: 23.4% and 23.4%). First-half TD: the same rate x the share of that position's touchdowns scored
  before halftime (2024-2025: QB 48.4%, RB 47.2%, WR 50.5%, TE 45.5%). This season's touchdowns come from the game logs
  (rushing + receiving; returns are about 1% of skill players' touchdowns), last season's from nflverse (returns too).

MODEL LINES (the fallback when neither site projects a player) are built the way books build them, from OPPORTUNITY:
  expected volume (targets, carries or pass attempts; recent games count more, last season counts like 1-3 games,
  injury-shortened games are left out) x the player's efficiency (catch rate, yards per target / carry / attempt,
  touchdowns per attempt; shrunk toward the position average) x this game (Vegas implied team total, the defense).
Volume freed up by injured teammates is added for receiving yards. A player coming off an injury-shortened game is
marked down (in testing those players hit their overs only 25-33% of the time). Lines end in .5.

Settings were tuned on 2024 and tested on every 2025 game they had never seen: overs hit 44-50% for every stat, and
they stay balanced for players whose role rose or fell, rookies, players returning from partial games, and at every line
height (very high or low projections are pulled back toward typical, as books do).

Model lines carry a chance (our projection against the line, blended 50/50 with the line and kept within 38-62%) but
no picks since Oct 25 2026: they were tested against model lines, not lines like the books', and the few players on them
are the ones the books are least likely to price the same way.

Two ways to run:
  python ff_lines.py            data job: reads ff_data.json + last season's stats, writes bet_inputs.json, lines.json
                                and the lines into ff_data.json
  python ff_lines.py --refresh  score job (every 10 minutes): reads bet_inputs.json + live.json (current ESPN odds)
                                and rewrites lines.json only when a line or pick actually changed
Every line keeps its opening value and each move with its reason (Vegas total, teammate news, injury status).
