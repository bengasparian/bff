"""Download the public data the pipeline needs (nflverse, DynastyProcess, FantasyPros consensus) into this folder,
and work out which season it is (season.json), so nothing has to be changed by hand from one season to the next.

  season in progress  -> that season, phase "season"
  schedule out, no game played yet -> that season, phase "preseason"
  last season finished, next schedule not out yet -> next season, phase "preseason" (draft prep on last season's data)

The model learns from the 13 completed seasons before the current one (their features are cached after the first
build, so later runs download only the last five). Files for the current season are optional:
they do not exist until its first game. The consensus rankings are optional too: without them the site uses its own
projections only.

  python fetch_data.py                 download everything and write season.json
  python fetch_data.py --season-only   only work out the season from the saved schedule (no downloads)
  (testing: BFF_AS_OF=YYYY-MM-DD pretends it is that day; BFF_HIDE_SCHED=2027 pretends a schedule is not out yet)

Files of completed seasons do not change, so a copy younger than a week (BFF_KEEP_DAYS) is kept instead of downloaded
again; the update job keeps them between runs with a weekly cache. The current season, rosters, depth charts and
rankings are downloaded every run.
